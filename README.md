# Universe
 - Use "GameObject.FindObjectOfType<Sun>()" to get Sun's data  
 - Use "transform.RotateAround" to make Earth(Moon) rotate around Sun(Earth)  

* Problem  
When using "transform.RotateAround" without putting Moon under Earth, Moon will not rotate Earth but only follow it. However, Earth can successfully rotate Sun
